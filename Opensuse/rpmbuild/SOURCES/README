This package will download and install the NVIDIA Accelerated Linux
Graphics Driver that brings accelerated 2D functionality and
high-performance OpenGL support to Linux x86 with the
use of NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs).

These drivers provide optimized hardware acceleration for OpenGL and X
applications and support nearly all recent NVIDIA GPU products
(see README.txt, Appendix A for a complete list of supported GPUs).
TwinView, TV-Out and flat panel displays are also supported.
